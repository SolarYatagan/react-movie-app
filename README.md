You need an API key from https://www.omdbapi.com/, you can get one by creating an account on their website.
After you got your API key, create a (**.env**) file at root directory of project, copy the line below to the file and replace YOUR_KEY with your OpenWeatherMap API Key.

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

Then clone this repository, install dependencies and run the local server

```bash
cd reactweather
npm install
npm start
```
At the moment, you can only find a movie, click on it and read some information about it. In the future, I would like to create a profile, a wish list for movies and watched sections.
I used [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) (Weather data API)
